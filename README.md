# Skill Diary Web
## Informational Stuff

I have decided to let you write a documentation of what you have learned.

Please keep this as your diary and write a short summary with code snippets and some theoretical topics daily in the last half an hour of the day.

Just to let you know this will be your personal reference book.

In this Repository we are gonna collect all information of the web classes.

As it is a personal documentation the styling and structure is up to your personal preferences.
